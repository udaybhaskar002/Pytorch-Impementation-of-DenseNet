# Pytorch-Impementation-of-DenseNet


A PyTorch Implementation for Densely Connected Convolutional Networks (DenseNets)

This repository contains a PyTorch implementation of the paper Densely Connected Convolutional Networks with Growth Rate =12 and Layers = 100.

The No of Parameters in this Model is around 0.8 M which makes it easy to train and requires lesser computational power

This repo consists of:
1) Different Data Augmentation we used in our experiments in data augmentation.ipynb 
2) DenseNet Exp Excel file has the Expermentitonal Results
3) Final_DenseNet_Copy.ipynb is the final model
